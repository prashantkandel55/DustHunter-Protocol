# 🛡️ Dusthunter Protocol

**Dusthunter Protocol** is a premium, high-fidelity cryptographic surveillance engine designed to identify, analyze, and neutralize potential threats to blockchain wallets. Built by **ancientiorr**, it combines the reasoning power of Gemini 3 with real-time web grounding to provide a tactical "Mission Control" interface for your digital assets.

## 🛰️ Intelligence Overview

In the modern decentralized landscape, wallets are constant targets for dusting attacks, zero-transfer poisoning, and phishing schemes. Dusthunter provides the ultimate recon tool to verify the integrity of any address on major chains (Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, Polygon).

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Strategic Search Grounding**: Utilizes Gemini 3's Google Search tool to scrape live data from Etherscan, Solscan, and other block explorers for the most up-to-date balances and event history.
- **Neural Attack Vector Breakdown**: Categorizes risks like Dusting, Poisoning, and Phishing with AI-driven likelihood scores.
- **Tactical Recon HUD**: A high-performance dashboard featuring:
  - **Safety Gauge**: A digital visualizer for the overall security score of a wallet.
  - **Live Terminal Log**: Real-time narration of the AI's thought process and network activity.
  - **Intelligence Matrix**: A temporal visualization of threat intensity over time.
- **Live Price Oracle**: Real-time valuation and 24h change tracking for all token holdings via the DexScreener API.
- **Permission Scrutiny**: Detects unlimited approvals and "exposed" contract vectors before they result in a drain.
- **Combat Watchlist**: Locally encrypted target monitoring for quick access to priority addresses.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Framework**: React 19 (ESM)
- **AI Engine**: Gemini 3 Pro (via `@google/genai`)
- **Data Grounding**: Google Search Tool
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Tactical/Cyberpunk Theme)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Live Pricing**: DexScreener Public API

## 📖 Operational Guide

1. **Engage Uplink**: Enter a target wallet address and select the corresponding blockchain.
2. **Execute Recon**: Click **ENGAGE** or **SCAN**. The neural engine will begin scraping public ledgers.
3. **Analyze HUD**:
   - Check the **Defense Score** for an immediate safety verdict.
   - Review **Neural Attack Vectors** for specific vulnerabilities.
   - Monitor the **Live Terminal** for background reconnaissance steps.
4. **Inspect Inventory**: Switch to the **Inventory** tab to see live-priced token balances.
5. **Neutralize Risks**: Use the **Security** tab to identify suspicious approvals that need to be revoked.
